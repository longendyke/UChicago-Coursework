README: Homework 2, CMSC 22100, Spring 2016

CONTENTS OF THIS DIRECTORY 

This zip file contains 12 files, in addition to this README:

Three signatures describing the NB language and evaluation relations on it:
- nb-sig.sml
- small-step-sig.sml
- big-step-sig.sml

Four implementations of those signatures:
- nb.sml
- small-step-1.sml
- small-step-2.sml
- big-step.sml

Testing infrastructure:
- check-sig.sml
- check.sml
- tests.sml

A generic Utils module, currently empty, if you have use for it:
- utils.sml

And the SML equivalent of a Makefile, to manage compilation:
- nb.cm

To use SML's compilation manager (its "make"), type CM.make and a
string naming the "Makefile", as follows:
- CM.make "nb.cm";

In the present case, CM.make "nb.cm" will compile all the source code
in these sml files and also run whatever tests you have written in the
Tests structure (tests.sml). When you run the tests, you will see
feedback at the console either of this form:
========> Tests: 2 tests passed!
or in the form of raised exceptions such as the following:
  Fail: Check.expect failure: foo

YOUR ASSIGNMENT

Your assignment is to complete this implementation of NB. Please begin
by reading the signatures. All the functions you need to write are
currently stubbed out with exception raising. If you grep for the
string TODO among the source files, you will see exactly which
functions these are:

$ grep TODO *.sml
big-step.sml:  fun eval _ = raise Fail "TODO: BigStep.eval"
nb.sml:  fun eq _ = raise Fail "TODO: NB.eq"
nb.sml:  fun tos _ = raise Fail "TODO: NB.tos"
nb.sml:  fun isNumVal _ = raise Fail "TODO: NB.isNumVal"
nb.sml:  fun isBoolVal _ = raise Fail "TODO: NB.isBoolVal"
nb.sml:  fun isVal _ = raise Fail "TODO: NB.isVal"
small-step-1.sml:  fun oneStep _ = raise Fail "TODO: SmallStep1.oneStep"
small-step-1.sml:  fun steps _ = raise Fail "TODO: SmallStep1.steps"
small-step-1.sml:  fun eval _ = raise Fail "TODO: SmallStep1.eval"
small-step-2.sml:  fun oneStep _ = raise Fail "TODO: SmallStep2.oneStep"
small-step-2.sml:  fun steps _ = raise Fail "TODO: SmallStep2.steps"
small-step-2.sml:  fun eval _ = raise Fail "TODO: SmallStep2.eval"

What these functions are supposed to do should be clear from the
comments interspersed throughout the structures and signatures. Here
is a summary:

- In nb.sml, implement various basic operations on terms in NB.

- In small-step-1.sml, implement the single-step evaluation relation
  given in Figures 3-1 and 3-2 of the text.

- In small-step-2.sml, implement a variation of the former such that
  if expressions are evaluated from right to left.

- In big-step.sml, implement the big-step evaluation relation given in
  exercise 3.5.17 in the text.

TESTING

The testing infrastructure (check-sig.sml, check.sml, and tests.sml)
is provided to assist you. You are strongly encouraged to fill in the
Tests structure with useful tests, but you will not be evaluated on
the number or quality of your tests. It's there only for your benefit.

SUBMISSION

Please submit all files in a directory hw2 in your repository by
11:59pm, Wednesday 4/13. Please submit all of the files named in this
README; you will not need any others.
