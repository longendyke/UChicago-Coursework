CMSC 22100 Spring 2016
Homework 6

Your assignment this week is to complete the three sketched-out Java
projects in the three directories herein: java-complex, java-ilist,
and java-PL. Makefiles and very lightweight testing frameworks are
included; browse around each directory to get a feel for what you need
to do. 

You will need the Java compiler "javac" on your system to complete
this assignment. As a permanent plan B (for this and other similar
software issues in this and other quarters), remember you can ssh into
a department machine and do your work there.

java-complex offers a simple implementation of a class for the
representation of complex numbers. If you've never written Java
before, start here.

java-ilist is a limited recapitulation of the ilist SML assignment. It
illustrates recursive object design, and is an interesting
counterpoint to recursive functional programming like we've been doing
this quarter.

java-PL is a Java implementation of some of the NBT language from the
text. If you haven't done this sort of recursive object programming
before, I recommend you start with java-ilist as a warm-up exercise.

Please note this assignment is due on Monday May 23 at 11:59pm -- not
the usual Wednesday deadline.
