Homework 7
University of Chicago, Spring 2016

This work is due Monday, June 6, 2016 at 11:59pm.

Graduating students need not complete this exercise, and won't be
graded on it if they do. Having said that, the exercise is good
preparation for the upcoming test, not to mention the highest ideal of
education, which is now and shall ever be learning for the sake of
learning itself. So, completion of the exercise is recommended for
graduating students, and, for all others, mandatory.

Your exercise is to complete the distinct labels check in parse.sml,
as well as an implementation of the subtyping relation in
ty.sml. Please note you should uncomment the call to chkDistinctLabels
in parse.sml once you have written that function.

The subtyping relation is described in full theoretical and practical
detail in Chapters 15 and following in the text. Everything you need
to know about subtyping all the types in ty.sml is presented in those
chapters.

Please note I've provided a simple front-end for scanning and parsing
types from strings, so that writing of unit tests is considerably more
pleasant. The (Scheme-like) concrete syntax of types in the given
front-end implementation is as follows:

ty ::= "Nat"
     | "Bool"
     | "(" "*" ty ty ")"
     | "(" "->" ty ty ")"
     | "{" label ":" ty "," ... "}"
     | "(" "Ref" ty ")"
     | "(" "List" ty ")"
     | "(" "Array" ty ")"
     | "Top"

Note a label is one or more lowercase letters together, as in "a",
"aa", "ab", "aaa", etc.
