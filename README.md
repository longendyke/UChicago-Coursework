# UChicago-Coursework
A repository containing various work from my undergraduate career at UChicago.

Included in this repo are four classes from the UChicago CS Major:
+ Networks and Distributed Systems
+ Programming Languages
+ Software Construction, and
+ Introduction to Databases

More information on these courses can be found here: http://collegecatalog.uchicago.edu/thecollege/computerscience/

In addition to these projects I've also worked on MIT's SimpleDB project for my Intro to Databases class. If you'd like to view my work, please contact me to request access.
